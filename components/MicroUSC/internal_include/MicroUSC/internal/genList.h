/**
 * @file genList.h
 * @brief Generic doubly-linked list manipulation routines for MicroUSC.
 *
 * This header defines a set of functions and structures for managing generic doubly-linked lists,
 * modeled after the Linux kernelâ€™s list implementation. It enables efficient insertion and removal
 * of elements at both the head and tail of the list, as well as deletion of arbitrary entries.
 * These utilities are used internally by the MicroUSC system for managing dynamic data structures,
 * such as driver configurations and runtime lists.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   - Include this header in modules that require dynamic list management.
 *   - Use list_add() and list_add_tail() to insert elements at the head or tail.
 *   - Use list_del() to remove elements from the list.
 *
 * @note All list operations assume the list_head structures are properly initialized before use.
 *       These routines are designed for modular, component-based embedded C projects and support
 *       manual file management and CMake-based dependency organization.
