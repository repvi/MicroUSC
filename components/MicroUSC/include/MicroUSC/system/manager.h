 * @brief Internal system and power management API for MicroUSC on ESP32/ESP8266.
 *
 * This header provides internal function declarations for system-level configuration,
 * error handling, power management, and RTC variable storage within the MicroUSC library.
 * It enables precise control over sleep/wakeup sources, custom error handler registration,
 * and persistent variable management, supporting robust embedded system design and modular
 * code organization.
 *
 * Key features:
 *   - Sleep mode and wakeup configuration (timer and GPIO-based)
 *   - RTC memory variable storage and retrieval for low-power retention
 *   - Custom and default system error handler management
 *   - System status code management for state transitions and diagnostics
 *   - One-time system setup and initialization routines 
 *   - **Single initialization:** Must be called exactly once at the start of app_main().
 *   - **Priority inheritance:** Sets up FreeRTOS task priorities for driver operations.
 *   - **Resource tracking:** Monitors memory and IRQ usage for embedded constraints.
 *   - **Dependency chain:** Initializes all core subsystems required by MicroUSC.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   - Include this header only in modules requiring direct access to MicroUSC system internals.
 *   - Call initialization and configuration routines during system startup or power mode transitions.
 *   - Use error handler and status code functions for robust error and state management.
 * 
 * Usage Protocol:
 * 1. Call `init_tiny_kernel();` as the very first line in your app_main().
 * 2. Do not re-initialize or call againâ€”subsequent calls will cause resource conflicts.
 * 3. After initialization, all driver, memory, and task management functions may be safely used.
 *
 * 
 * @warning Calling this after any other MicroUSC initialization or driver/memory setup
 *          will cause resource conflicts, memory corruption, and unpredictable system behavior.
 * 
 * @note This header is intended for internal use within the MicroUSC library and should not be exposed
 *       to application-level code unless advanced system control is required.

 * @brief Set a custom system error handler for the microcontroller system.
 *
 * This function allows the application to register a custom error handler function

 * system-level error or exception occurs, replacing any previously set handler,
 * including the default handler.
 *
 * Custom error handlers are useful for:
 *   - Logging or reporting errors in an application-specific way
 *   - Attempting recovery actions or cleanup after faults
 *   - Integrating with higher-level error management frameworks
 *   - Providing user feedback or diagnostics
 *
 * The handler function must match the signature defined by `microusc_error_handler`.
 * Passing a NULL pointer may disable error handling or restore default behavior,
 * depending on the system implementation.
 *
 * @param handler  Pointer to the custom error handler function to be registered.
 *
 * @note
 * - The error handler will be invoked in the context where the error occurs, which
 *   may be an interrupt, exception, or main application context.
 * - The handler should be efficient and avoid blocking operations, especially if
 *   called from an interrupt or fault context.
 * - Registering a new handler overrides any previously set handler.
 * - To restore the default error handler, use set_microusc_system_error_handler_default().

 *       microusc_status enum or macro set.

 *
 * Typical responsibilities of the default error handler may include:
 *   - Logging or displaying error messages for debugging or user feedback.
 *   - Recording error codes or statuses for later retrieval or analysis.
 *   - Attempting safe recovery from certain error conditions, if possible.
 *   - Halting the system or triggering a system reset in case of fatal errors.
 *
 * This function is intended to be called during system initialization or when
 * resetting the error handling mechanism to a known-safe state.
 *
 * @note
 * - Custom error handlers may be installed elsewhere in the code. Calling this
 *   function will override any previously set custom handler with the default.
 * - The implementation may vary depending on the system architecture and requirements.
 * - For embedded systems, the default handler should be robust and avoid undefined behavior.
