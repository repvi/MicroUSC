# USC Drivers

Start the program by creating your own universal serial connection protocol.

## How to use the program

Follow detailed instructions provided specifically for this example.

Create or use a pre-made driver for your selected ESP32 type.

## Example folder contents

The project **hello_world** contains one source file in C language [hello_world_main.c](main/hello_world_main.c). The file is located in folder [main](main).

ESP-IDF projects are built using CMake. The project build configuration is contained in `CMakeLists.txt` files that provide set of directives and instructions describing the project's source files and targets (executable, library, or both).

Below is short explanation of remaining files in the project folder.
```

For more information on structure and contents of ESP-IDF projects, please refer to Section [Build System](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/build-system.html) of the ESP-IDF Programming Guide.

## Troubleshooting

* Program upload failure

    * Hardware connection is not correct: run `idf.py -p PORT monitor`, and reboot your board to see if there are any output logs.
    * The baud rate for downloading is too high: lower your baud rate in the `menuconfig` menu, and try again.

## Technical support and feedback

Please use the following feedback channels:

* For technical queries, go to the [esp32.com](https://esp32.com/) forum
* For a feature request or bug report, create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues)
